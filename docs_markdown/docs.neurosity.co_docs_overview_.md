The Neurosity software processes and manages the data produced by [Neurosity headsets](https://neurosity.co/) which measures, tracks and monitors EEG brainwaves.

The SDK is built with privacy and simplicity in mind. Our mission is to build the next major computing platform. A platform that learns from you. The first step in building this platform is to make applications that add value to people's lives.

We've created the SDK to empower developers to build neuro-driven and accessible apps, quickly and easily.

We know some of the best apps will be written by the community, so we've open-sourced the SDK to provide visibility and transparency to our users.

This documentation describes:

- How to authenticate, query, train, and use Neurosity devices
- How to take advantage of the SDK
- Where to find guides and code samples to help you get started

## What can the SDK do? [​](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/overview/\#what-can-the-sdk-do "Direct link to What can the SDK do?")

Here are some examples of what you can achieve with the SDK:

- Authenticate and access Neurosity devices - [Authentication](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/authentication)
- Allow Neurosity users to connect their account to your third-party app - [OAuth](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/oauth)
- Get device info and status - [Info](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/info) or [Status](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/status)
- Check signal quality - [Signal Quality](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/signal-quality)
- Get a persons's mental states metrics - [Calm](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/calm) or [Focus](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/focus)
- Train a new motor-based thought - [Training](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/guides/training)
- Use a trained thought for control - [Kinesis](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/kinesis)
- Interact with system haptics - [Haptics](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/api/haptics)

## How to use the SDK? [​](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/overview/\#how-to-use-the-sdk "Direct link to How to use the SDK?")

Building a good application with the SDK can take a lot of effort. Here is what each section of the API docs can help you with:

- **Get Started** teaches fundamental concepts for using the SDK
- **Guides** includes in-depth guides on various SDK development topics, such as [ethics](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/guides/ethics) and [training](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/guides/training).
- **References** contains exhaustive references for the [SDK](https://docs.neurosity.co/docs/reference/classes/Neurosity).
